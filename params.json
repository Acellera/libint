{"name":"Libint","tagline":"Libint is a high-performance library for computing Gaussian integrals in quantum mechanics","body":"libint\r\n==================\r\n\r\nwhat is libint\r\n------------------\r\nlibint is two things:\r\n    1. a library of C/C++ functions for efficient evaluation of several kinds of two-body molecular integrals over Gaussian functions;\r\n    2. the optimizing compiler that generates a Libint library.\r\n\r\nwho needs libint\r\n------------------\r\nDevelopers of scientific software, such as for molecular electronic structure. In molecular electronic structure theory Gaussian basis sets are standard because they allow efficient evaluation of matrix elements of operators (molecular integrals). Modern electronic structure programs spend considerable portion of their runtime computing the Coulomb two-electron integrals. While anyone can compute Gaussian integrals using simple formulas (see, for example, <a href=\"http://www.files.chem.vt.edu/chem-dept/valeev/docs/ints.pdf\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.files.chem.vt.edu/chem-dept/valeev/docs/project_ints.11292007.pdf\">here</a>), the efficient evaluation of many-body can be (relatively) complicated. Libint is an open library that anyone can use to compute a variety of two-electron integrals, most importantly the Coulomb two-electron integrals and their arbitrary-order geometric derivatives, over Gaussians of arbitrary angular momentum. Among other notable features is the support for the nonstandard two-electron integrals that appear in explicitly correlated R12 methods.\r\n\r\nversions of libint\r\n------------------\r\nThe older libint is version 1.1.x . It is incorporated into <a href=\"www.psicode.org\">Psi</a> package and can be used with <a href=\"www.mpqc.org\">MPQC</a> program. It is no longer developed, and minimally supported; download it <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/v1-releases/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe latest major version of Libint is 2 . Libint2 has been in use internally since 2004; in fact it is more stable than version 1. It has now been improved to production-ready status and officially released on April 25, 2011.\r\n\r\nwhere libint is used\r\n------------------\r\nIt is currently used by production releases of <a href=\"www.mpqc.org\">MPQC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thch.uni-bonn.de/tc/orca/\">ORCA</a>, <a href=\"www.psicode.org\">Psi</a>, and <a href=\"http://cp2k.berlios.de/\">CP2K</a> packages.\r\n\r\nhow to get libint\r\n------------------\r\nThe vast majority of users will not be interested in tinkering with the compiler -- and, thus, are recommended to download one of pre-generated libraries:\r\n    1. MPQC users can download a Libint 2.0 library with support for Coulomb and R12 integrals over up to l=7 functions <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/libint-for-mpqc/\">here</a>;\r\n    2. Electronic structure enthusiasts who want to experiment with Libint should simply download the library configured for MPQC (see iter 1) and obtain the programmer guide and test program <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/libint-for-beginners/\">here</a>;\r\n    3. ORCA users do not need to obtain Libint -- Libint version 2 has been integrated into ORCA;\r\n    4. Psi users do not need to obtain Libint -- Libint version 1 has been integrated into Psi.\r\n\r\nIf you want to download the Libint compiler to generate a custom Libint library -- you can check it out from the source repository!
