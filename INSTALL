The installation procedure for the impatient and/or experts:
0) only if obtained the compiler source via Mercurial:
   aclocal -I lib/autoconf; autoconf
1) create a directory for object files:
   mkdir ../build; cd ../build
2) configure the package:
   ../configure
   Most often you will need to specify command-line options to configure.
   To obtain a list of configure options run 'configure --help'.

then either choose path a or b:

3a) build the Libint compiler, then generate and compile a library:
   make
4a) optional validation of the library:
  cd tests/eri
  make
  ./test 0
  ./test 1 (if derivative Coulomb integrals were enabled)
  ./test 2 (if second-derivative Coulomb integrals were enabled)
  cd ../..
5a) install the compiled library:
  make install

3b) build the Libint compiler, then generate and package a library for redistribution
   make export
   this produce a tarball with a Libint library that can be unpacked, configured, and compiled elsewhere.
